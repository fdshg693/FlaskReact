Economy facts
Inflation
  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) 12-month inflation rate peaked 
at 9.0% in June 2022, the highest since the early 1980s. It cooled 
to below 4% from June to December 2023.
  Consumers faced prices in December 2023 that were 20.4% 
higher for food, 18.7% higher for shelter, and 33.5% higher for 
energy than in January 2021.
  To combat inflation, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates 
seven times in 2022 and four times in 2023, reaching a target 
range of 5.25% to 5.50% by late July 2023.
  The Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE) 12-month 
inflation rate inched towards the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 
2% year-over-year inflation in 2023 and the beginning of 2024.
Economic growth
  In 2023, real GDP (GDP adjusted for inflation) increased 2.5%, which 
is above the average annual rate of 2.1% from 2000 through 2022.
  From 2022 to 2023, real GDP decreased in one state, Delaware, and 
increased by more than 5.5% in North Dakota and Texas.
  In 2023, US employers added approximately 3.1 million jobs, 
indicating growth but at a slower pace than in 2021 and 2022. 
Florida, Nevada, Texas, and Alaska saw job increases of 3% or more.
US trade
  The US trade deficit decreased by 22% from 2022 to 2023, from 
$990.3 billion to $773.4 billion. 
  The services trade surplus increased to $288.2 billion in 2023, 
reversing a four-year downward trend. 
  Canada remained the nation’s top trading partner in 2023, 
followed by Mexico and China, marking the first time in 20 years 
that the US imported more from Mexico than China. 
  The country’s largest trade deficit was with China, totaling 
$253.4 billion. 
Labor market
  The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.6% in 2023, 
matching the previous year. These were the lowest levels since 
1969. Rates varied across states, from a 1.9% low in North 
Dakota to a 5.1% high in Nevada.
  The 2023 job openings rate averaged 5.7%, or about 9.35 
million job openings. This is down 1.1 percentage points from 
the 2022 peak, but higher than any other year prior to 2021.
  The labor force participation rate was 62.6% in 2023, slightly 
below the 2019 level. State participation rates varied, with 
Mississippi at the low end and Utah at the high end.
